# Covid-Dataset-Exploration-using-SQL

This project explores COVID-19 datasets using SQL to analyze infection rates, death counts, and vaccination statistics. It includes queries for calculating death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination coverage, with insights into countries and continents with the highest metrics.

## Features

- **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths**: Calculate and analyze the percentage of deaths relative to total cases for specific locations.
- **Total Cases vs. Population**: Assess the infection rate as a percentage of the population for specific locations.
- **Countries with Highest Infection Rates**: Identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
- **Countries with Highest Death Counts**: Determine which countries have the highest total death counts.
- **Continents with Highest Death Counts**: Aggregate death counts by continent and identify the continent with the highest death count.
- **Total Death Percentage**: Compute the overall death percentage across the dataset.
- **People Vaccinated Till Date**: Calculate the cumulative number of vaccinations administered up to each date for various locations.
- **Vaccination Percentage Till Date**: Determine the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated up to each date.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have access to a SQL database environment where you can execute the provided queries.
2. **Database Setup**: Load the COVID-19 datasets (`coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations`) into your database.
3. **Execute Queries**: Run the provided SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.

## Usage

- **Filter Data**: Use the first query to filter and view raw COVID-19 data.
- **Analyze Metrics**: Utilize the subsequent queries to calculate various metrics like death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination coverage.
- **Aggregate Insights**: Use CTEs and views to aggregate and rank data for deeper insights.
